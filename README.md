## Description

This represents a RESTful API designed for a social networking web platform where individuals can exchange ideas, respond to the thoughts of their peers, and establish a roster of friends. This API is constructed employing Express.js for handling routing, leverages a MongoDB database, and incorporates the Mongoose Object Data Modeling (ODM) library. It furnishes endpoints to facilitate the creation, retrieval, modification, and deletion of user profiles, posts, responses, as well as the management of social connections.
